## Implementation Details

### File Location
`Backend/services/cronJobs.js`

### Dependencies
```javascript
const { sendMonthlyReport, sendWeeklyReport } = require('../scripts/whatsappReport');
const siteSchema = require('../models/Siteschema');
const User = require('../models/Userschema');
```

### User Selection Criteria
```javascript
User.find({ 
    isActive: true,
    sites: { $exists: true, $not: { $size: 0 } }
})
```

**Filters**:
- Only active users (`isActive: true`)
- Users must have at least one site
- Sends report for each site the user owns

### Rate Limiting
- **Weekly Reports**: 1 second delay between each report
- **Monthly Reports**: 1.5 seconds delay between each report
- Prevents WhatsApp API rate limiting
- Ensures stable delivery

## February Handling

### Problem
- Most months have 29+ days
- February has 28 days (non-leap) or 29 days (leap)
- Week 4 job on 29th won't run in non-leap February

### Solution
- **Leap Years** (2024, 2028, etc.): Week 4 job runs on Feb 29
- **Non-Leap Years** (2025, 2026, etc.): Special job runs on Feb 28
- Special job checks if it's a leap year and skips if true

### Leap Year Detection
```javascript
const isLeapYear = (year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || (year % 400 === 0);
```

### Examples
| Year | Type | Feb Days | Job That Runs |
|------|------|----------|---------------|
| 2024 | Leap | 29 | Week 4 (Feb 29) |
| 2025 | Non-Leap | 28 | Feb 28 Special |
| 2026 | Non-Leap | 28 | Feb 28 Special |
| 2028 | Leap | 29 | Week 4 (Feb 29) |

## Manual Testing

### Manual Trigger Methods

```javascript
// Weekly Reports
await cronJobService.manualTriggerWeeklyReportWeek1();
await cronJobService.manualTriggerWeeklyReportWeek2();
await cronJobService.manualTriggerWeeklyReportWeek3();
await cronJobService.manualTriggerWeeklyReportWeek4();

// Monthly Report
await cronJobService.manualTriggerMonthlyReport();
```

### Testing Routes (Add to cronRoutes.js if needed)
```javascript
router.post('/trigger/weekly-week1', async (req, res) => {
    await cronJobService.manualTriggerWeeklyReportWeek1();
    res.json({ success: true });
});

router.post('/trigger/monthly', async (req, res) => {
    await cronJobService.manualTriggerMonthlyReport();
    res.json({ success: true });
});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Load Distribution
- Jobs run at 2 AM (low traffic period)
- Different days prevent overlapping
- Rate limiting prevents API overload

### Estimated Duration
Assuming 100 users with 2 sites each (200 reports):
- With 1 second delay: ~3.3 minutes
- With 1.5 second delay: ~5 minutes

### Scalability
For larger user bases:
- Consider batch processing
- Implement queue system (Bull, BeeQueue)
- Distribute across multiple servers
- Increase rate limit delays if API errors occur

---

## Maintenance

### Adding New Cron Jobs
1. Define schedule in `init()` method
2. Create handler method
3. Add manual trigger method
4. Test with manual trigger
5. Monitor logs after first scheduled run

### Modifying Schedules
1. Update cron expression in `init()`
2. Restart service
3. Verify in logs: `üìÖ Scheduled job: [name] with schedule: [cron]`

### Disabling Cron Jobs
```javascript
// Comment out in init()
// this.scheduleJob('weekly-report-week1', '0 2 8 * *', this.sendWeeklyReportWeek1.bind(this));
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Cron Not Running
‚úÖ Check if cronJobs.init() is called in server.js
‚úÖ Verify timezone setting
‚úÖ Check server date/time with `date` command
‚úÖ Review cron expression syntax

### Reports Not Sending
‚úÖ Check WhatsApp template is approved
‚úÖ Verify environment variables
‚úÖ Test with manual trigger
‚úÖ Check user has valid phone number
‚úÖ Review S3 upload permissions

### Wrong Data in Reports
‚úÖ Verify date calculation logic
‚úÖ Check monthly vs weekly data fetching
‚úÖ Test with specific date range manually

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Daily Reports**: Option for daily summaries
2. **Custom Schedules**: Per-user report preferences
3. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed sends
4. **Report Queue**: Background job queue for better scaling
5. **Email Reports**: Alternative delivery method
6. **SMS Notifications**: Backup notification channel
7. **Report Analytics**: Track open rates, download counts

### Optimization Opportunities
1. Parallel processing for multiple sites
2. Caching site data to reduce DB queries
3. Pre-generate reports and send in batches
4. Implement circuit breaker for WhatsApp API
