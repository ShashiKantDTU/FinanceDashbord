Section 1: Hero Section - Design Layout
This design focuses on a clean, two-column layout that is professional yet easy to understand. The goal is to guide the user's eye naturally from the brand, to the value proposition, and finally to the call-to-action, with the visual proof right beside it.

1. Navigation Bar: Clean & Functional

The top bar establishes the brand identity and provides essential navigation without causing clutter.

Layout: A single, clean horizontal bar at the very top with ample white space.

Logo (Left):

The "Site Haazri" logo is placed on the far left.

Visual Idea: A simple, strong wordmark. Consider a subtle icon integrated with the name, like a stylized hard hat or a checkmark, to hint at "attendance" and "site work."

Menu (Right):

Simple text links: Features, Pricing, Contact Us.

The font is clean and smaller than the main headlines.

A final, slightly distinct button on the far right: [Login], for existing users. This can be a simple "ghost button" (a button with an outline but no fill color).

2. Main Content: Two-Column Structure

Below the navigation, the section is split into two columns for desktop view. On mobile, the text column (2a) will stack on top of the image column (2b).

2a. Left Column: The Core Message (The "Why")

This side contains all the text. It's aligned to the left to make it easy to read.

Main Headline (H1):

Text: "Site Haazri – Aapke Site ka Smart Manager"

Design: This is the largest and boldest text on the page. Use a modern, sans-serif font. The color should be a strong, dark brand color (e.g., deep navy blue or charcoal grey) to convey professionalism.

Subheading:

Text: "Attendance, Daily Reports aur Site Ka Poora Record – Sab kuch ek hi app mein."

Design: Placed directly below the headline. It's significantly smaller in size but still very legible. Use a slightly lighter shade than the headline to create a clear visual hierarchy.

Call-to-Action (CTA) Buttons:

Primary CTA:

Text: [📲 App Install Karein]

Design: This is the main event. A large, unmissable button with a solid, bright, and encouraging color (like a vibrant construction-orange or a trustworthy green). The text is bold and white. Adding the phone or app store icon gives a clear visual cue.

Secondary CTA:

Text: Demo Dekhein or Humse Baat Karein

Design: Placed just below the primary button. This should be much less visually demanding. A great option is a text link with an arrow: Demo Dekhein →. This gives users a clear second option without competing with the main CTA.

2b. Right Column: The Visual Proof (The "How")

This side is dedicated to a single, powerful image that shows the app in a relatable context.

Hero Image:

Concept: A high-resolution photo or a very realistic 3D render of a smartphone.

Context: The phone is held by a hand that looks like it belongs on a construction site—clean, but clearly a worker's hand. This adds authenticity.

App Mockup: The phone screen displays the app's simplest and most valuable feature.

Option A (Best for Simplicity): The "Mark Attendance" screen. It shows a list of 3-4 worker names with simple "Present" / "Absent" toggles next to them. The UI is clean, with big fonts and lots of space.

Option B (Shows More Value): The "Daily Work Report" screen, designed to look like a simple digital form, not a complex spreadsheet.

Visual Flair: The phone mockup could have a subtle shadow to make it "pop" from the background. You could also have small, simple graphic icons (like a cement mixer, a brick, a hard hat) floating softly in the background behind the phone to add a touch of personality without being distracting.

3. Background & Overall Feel

Color Palette: The overall background should be a very light, neutral color like off-white or a faint cool grey. This makes the content and the brand colors stand out.

Atmosphere: The combination of clean fonts, ample spacing, a professional color scheme, and relatable Hinglish text creates a feeling of a modern, trustworthy, and easy-to-use tool. It says, "This is a serious software, but it was built for you."

Section 2: Samasya aur Samadhan (Problem & Solution)

This section uses a story-telling approach. It first connects with the user's daily frustrations ("Samasya") and then introduces the app's features as the ultimate "Samadhan" (Solution). The visual design will separate these two parts to create a clear before-and-after effect.

1. Section Heading: Bold & Centered

Layout: The section begins with a strong, centered headline to grab attention.

Main Heading Text: "Roz ke Site ke Jhanjhat, Ab Sirf Ek App se Hal!"

Sub-heading Text: "Contractor aur Supervisor dono ke kaam ab smart tareeke se honge."

Design: The main heading is large and bold. The sub-heading is smaller and in a slightly lighter color, providing context.

2. The "Samasya" Zone: Highlighting the Pain Points

This area will have a slightly different background color (e.g., a very light, almost unnoticeable grey or beige) to visually group the problems together.

Layout: A three-column layout on desktop, where each column is a "Problem Card." These cards will stack vertically on mobile devices.

Problem Cards Design:

Visual: Each card is clean and simple, with a soft border or a light drop shadow.

Icon: At the top of each card, a simple, universally understood line-art icon in a muted red or orange color to signify a problem.

Card 1 Icon: A "lost document" or "messy papers" icon.

Card 2 Icon: A "ringing phone" or "repeated calls" icon.

Card 3 Icon: A "calculator" or "hourglass" icon.

Content:

Heading (e.g., "Attendance Register gum ho jaye toh?"): Presented in bold text.

Description: Regular, easy-to-read text below the heading.

3. The "Samadhan" Zone: Introducing the Solution

This area transitions back to the clean, white background of the page, creating a sense of clarity and relief.

Bridge Statement:

Text: "Supervisor ko app do, woh data dalega – aapke phone par sab auto-update hoga!"

Design: This powerful statement sits between the problem and solution zones. It should be centered, in a larger font, and possibly in the main brand color to serve as a turning point.

Benefit Cards Layout:

Layout: A grid of cards (e.g., 2x2 or 3x2) to showcase the key benefits. This looks organized and professional.

Benefit Cards Design:

Visual: These cards feel brighter and more positive than the problem cards. They can have a border in the brand's primary color (e.g., green or blue).

Icon: Each card features a positive icon in the primary brand color.

Icons: , , , , ``.

Content: The Feature is a bold heading, and the Description follows in standard text.

4. Feature Highlight & Trust Builders

These elements are designed to stand out from the card grid to address key selling points and build trust.

Feature Highlight Box:

Layout: A full-width container with a distinct background color (e.g., a light yellow or light blue) that contrasts with the white background.

Design: It should feel like a special note. An icon like a star or a lightbulb can be placed next to the heading.

Text: The quote-like text inside is italicized or set in a slightly different font to make it feel like a direct piece of advice.

Bonus Trust Note (Q&A):

Layout: Positioned just below the highlight box, this is designed as a mini FAQ to handle a critical objection.

Design:

Concern: The text "Concern:" is bold and in a cautionary color (like orange).

Answer: The text "Answer:" is bold and in a reassuring color (like green). This Q&A format is very easy to scan and digest.

5. Final Call-to-Action

CTA Button:

Text: [Demo Dekhiye – Kaise Kaam Karta Hai Site Haazri]

Design: A large, centered button that matches the style of the primary CTA in the Hero Section. This provides a clear next step for the user after they've understood the value proposition.

Layout: After the feature grid, a full-width, visually distinct strip breaks the flow and delivers a key message.

Next to the photo, the Name & Region ("Shyam Lal, Bhopal") is in bold.
